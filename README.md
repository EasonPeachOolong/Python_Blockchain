# Python_Blockchain
What does the project do?
Building a Blockchain in Python...

Why?
Learning through building.

Update?
I'm planning to deploy the API on a test blockchain, so any recommendation?
Or I'll look for it.

Notation?
I haven't recurred everything like the difficulty bomb and obviously the proof of work is not adjustable.
